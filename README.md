# 🧠 DeepRetina: Automated Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy and Glaucoma using Retinal Fundus Images

DeepRetina is a deep learning-based system for **automated detection of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)** and **Glaucoma** using retinal fundus images.  
The project integrates **EfficientNet-B3** and **EfficientNet-B4** architectures enhanced with **Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention**, advanced preprocessing, and robust augmentation techniques to achieve high diagnostic accuracy and clinical reliability.

---

## 📘 Overview

Retinal diseases such as **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)** and **Glaucoma** are leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide. This project aims to build an end-to-end AI pipeline capable of automatically detecting these diseases from fundus images with high precision.

Key highlights:
- **EfficientNet-B4 backbone** with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Attention.
- **CLAHE** (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) preprocessing.
- **Advanced Augmentation:** Flip, rotation, brightness/contrast adjustments, MixUp, CutMix.
- **Optimized Training:** AdamW optimizer, cosine learning rate decay, label smoothing.
- **Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)** for stable inference.
- **~97% accuracy** on the cleaned dataset (4-class classification: Cataract, DR, Glaucoma, Normal).

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/DeepRetina.git
cd DeepRetina
````

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv

## Running the Demo

To test the trained model interactively:

```bash
cd demo
python deepretina_demo.py
```

The demo displays a grid of sample fundus images.

* Enter an image index (0–11) to test prediction on that image.
* The model outputs:

  * **True label**
  * **Predicted label**
  * **Confidence score**
  * **Probability distribution**
* A green “✔ Correct!” message appears for correct predictions.

## 🧪 How to Retrain

To train from scratch:

```bash
cd training
python train_b4.py
```

This will:

* Load preprocessed images from dataset folders
* Apply CLAHE, augmentations, and MixUp/CutMix
* Train EfficientNet-B4 with attention and log performance metrics
* Save best weights under `/models/`

---

## Future Work

* Implement **dual-head EfficientNet-B4** for independent DR and Glaucoma detection
* Add **Explainable AI (Grad-CAM / SHAP)** for clinical interpretability
* Expand dataset diversity with external validation
* Deploy via **TensorFlow Lite / ONNX** for real-time teleophthalmology
